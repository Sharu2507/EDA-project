# 📊 Data Analysis Projects – Phase 1

This repository contains Phase 1 of two exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects:

1. **Air Quality Dataset (UCI Repository)**
2. **AI Jobs Dataset**

Both projects include complete data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, and Matplotlib-based visualizations.

---

## 🔍 Project 1: Air Quality Dataset (UCI)

### 📁 Dataset Source:

* [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Air Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/air+quality)

### 📌 Objectives:

* Analyze air quality indicators over time.
* Clean sensor data with invalid values.
* Visualize pollutant trends using basic plots.

### ✅ Phase 1 Includes:

* Data loading and inspection
* Handling missing/invalid values (e.g., `-200`)
* Date parsing and time-based features (Month, Day, Hour)
* Descriptive statistics
* Initial univariate and bivariate visualizations with `Matplotlib`:

  * Line plots for pollutants
  * Bar plots for monthly trends
  * Scatter plots for variable relationships

---

## 👩‍💻 Project 2: AI Jobs Dataset

### 📁 Dataset Source:

* Kaggle or any job-related dataset containing AI-related roles, salaries, experience levels, etc.

### 📌 Objectives:

* Explore AI job market trends.
* Understand salary ranges by title and experience.
* Perform categorical and numerical analysis.

### ✅ Phase 1 Includes:

* Data loading and inspection
* Basic cleaning (e.g., missing values, standardizing categories)
* Feature extraction (e.g., splitting job titles, experience mapping)
* Descriptive analysis
* Visualizations using `Matplotlib`:

  * Bar plots (e.g., top job titles)
  * Grouped bar charts (e.g., min salary by experience)
  * Pie charts (e.g., role distribution)
  * Scatter plots for salary comparison

## 📦 Python Libraries Used

```python
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
```

---

## 📌 Next Steps (Phase 2 Preview)

* Advanced visualizations with `Seaborn`
* Correlation analysis
* Outlier detection and treatment
* Grouping and aggregation
* Dashboards or interactive plots (e.g., Plotly)
* Begin modeling (if applicable)
