# 📊 Project Phase 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis

This folder contains **Phase 1** of two real-world EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) projects using Python and key data analysis libraries.

---

## 📌 Included Projects

### 1️⃣ **Air Quality Dataset (UCI Repository)**

- Dataset contains hourly sensor readings of various air pollutants.
- Focused on:
  - Cleaning invalid values (e.g., `-200`)
  - Handling date-time columns
  - Extracting features: `Month`, `Day`, `Hour`
  - Basic descriptive statistics
  - Matplotlib visualizations for pollutant trends over time

### 2️⃣ **AI Jobs Dataset**

- Dataset contains information on AI-related job titles, salary ranges, and experience levels.
- Focused on:
  - Cleaning and formatting categorical data
  - Analyzing job roles and salary patterns
  - Extracting and grouping by experience and title
  - Visualizing trends using:
    - Bar charts
    - Grouped bar plots
    - Pie charts
    - Scatter plots

---

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries Used So Far

- **Pandas** for data handling
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** for creating various static plots
- Basic Python functions for data wrangling

---

## ✅ What’s Covered in Phase 1

- Dataset loading and inspection
- Missing value handling and replacements
- Feature extraction and data type conversions
- Initial visualizations with Matplotlib for:
  - Trends in air pollution levels
  - Role-wise salary comparisons
  - Pie charts for job distribution

---

## 🔜 Next Phase (Coming Up)

- Advanced plotting with **Seaborn**
- Correlation analysis
- Statistical summaries
- Outlier treatment and transformations
- Further analysis with more datasets

---

📂 This folder is part of a larger EDA project repository where each phase is tracked separately for better structure and learning.
