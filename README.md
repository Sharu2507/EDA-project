# 📊 EDA Project Repository – Exploratory Data Analysis Phases

Welcome to the **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** project repository!  
This repo contains multiple phases of EDA projects using real-world datasets to explore, clean, and visualize data.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To perform structured data analysis using popular Python libraries and techniques including:

- 📦 **Data Cleaning**  
- 📈 **Data Visualization**  
- 🧮 **Statistical Analysis**  
- 🧹 **Outlier Detection and Treatment**

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- 🐍 Python 3.x  
- 📊 **Pandas** – Data manipulation and preprocessing  
- 🧮 **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- 📉 **Matplotlib** – Plotting and basic visualizations  
- 📌 **Seaborn** – Statistical and advanced plots  
- 🧼 **IQR Method & Z-score** – Outlier detection and handling

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure

This repository is organized by **phases**, each phase covering specific steps of the EDA process.


---

## ✅ What’s Done So Far (Phase 1 Summary)

- Loaded and inspected raw data from multiple datasets
- Cleaned missing and invalid values 
- Converted date/time columns, extracted `Month`, `Day`, `Hour`
- Used **Matplotlib** to:
  - Create bar charts, line plots, scatter plots
  - Visualize pollutant levels and job trends
---

## 📌 Upcoming (Future Phases)

- Advanced plotting with **Seaborn**
- Correlation heatmaps
- Data transformation for skewed features
- Feature engineering and grouping

---

## 📚 Datasets Used

- [UCI Air Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality)
- [AI Jobs Dataset] – Contains job title, salary range, experience, and more
